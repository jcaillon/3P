* Tooltips are another important part of 3P, they quickly provide information on a word (as long as it is known by the software). You can activate them by simply hovering a word with your cursor :

* Each type of word has its own way of displaying information. For instance, hovering a statement keyword will show you its syntax :

* Sometimes, several definitions are available for a word. For instance, the word `ASSIGN` is an ABL *statement*, but is also a *method*. You can loop through the various definitions by holding the `CTRL` key and pressing the `DOWN` arrow key (also works with `UP`)

* In another case, you might want to keep the tooltip open when you move your mouse ; in order, for example, to click the `Go to definition` link of a procedure's tooltip. You might want to press the `CTRL` key to do just that
