## The code explorer ##

* The code explorer acts as an improved `function list`, well known to the notepad++ users. It displays the structure of the program and provides a quick way to jump from a code's portion to another (left click an item to get redirected to it) :

* The code explorer provides way more information than your usual function list ; and it can sometimes be overwhelming. You can reduce the amount of information at any time by expanding/collapsing one or all categories :

* You can also filter the items by typing a word in the textbox available for this end :
