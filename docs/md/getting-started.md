All 3P's features are accessible from this menu, this is the main entry point. Once you are familiar with the software, you can use the direct shortcuts.


## Setting an environment ##

3P has a lot of features that are available immediately, like the auto-completion or the syntax highlighting. **However,** if you want to enable the **FULL POTENTIAL** of this software, like :

- auto-completing database tables/fields,
- compiling, running your program from notepad++,

- analyzing the included files (.i) or the `PERSISENT` procedures of your code
- and so on...

You need to **provide info to 3P**!
