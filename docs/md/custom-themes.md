# Create your own themes #

*<small>Last update of this page : 27/04/2016</small>*

Two topics are discussed here:

- creating / modifying a syntax highlighting theme
- creating / modifying an application theme

## Syntax themes ##

This kind of theme only concerns the part of notepad++ where the text is edited:

You can edit the foreground/background color and font weight of any type of keywords displayed in your progress files.

By default, you can only select through a limited amount of options in the `OPTIONS` > `COLOR SCHEMES` page of the application, as shown below :

To be able to define your own themes, you first need to **EXPORT** the internal list of themes into an external file that you will be able to edit.

For that, go to the `OPTIONS` > `SHARE/EXPORT CONFIG` page:

Click the export ![image](content_images/66fd7c40-f142-11e5-9b9d-8a16d11edfde.png) button of the line **Syntax highlighting themes list**. The file is now exported:

You can open the file in Notepad++ by clicking left on the open button ![image](content_images/0e75380e-f144-11e5-98c0-b8015017ff69.png). When your modifications are done, click the import button ![image](content_images/244dbc96-f144-11e5-8056-0615be74f5dd.png) to apply your changes.

## Application themes ##

The application themes define the colors of every interfaces of 3P. This includes the main application, the auto-completion, the file explorer, the code explorer, the tool-tips, the notifications and so on...

Follow the same procedure as for the syntax themes to define your own colors. You have to export the line **Application themes list** instead of the **Syntax highlighting themes list**:
