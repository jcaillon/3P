You create the handle and assign it to a handle variable with the CREATE X-NODEREF statement.	cType = X-noderef-handle:SUBTYPE NO-ERROR.IF VALID-HANDLE(X-noderef-handle) AND cType = 'ELEMENT' THEN DO:   /*** your code ***/END.	x-noderef-handle [ :attribute | :method ]	
Xor Method	Performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation on the underlying values of the specified enumeration types and returns a new instance. You typically use this method to toggle a flag.	EnumHelper:Xor ( INPUT enum1 AS CLASS System.Enum, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INPUT enum2 AS CLASS System.Enum )	
Y Attribute	The pixel location of the top edge of the widget relative to the top edge of the parent widget or the display. The pixel location of the mouse cursor relative to the top edge of the display (for the last mouse event). This attribute is functionally equivalent to the ROW attribute.

YEAR Function	Evaluates a date expression and returns the year value of that date, including the century, as an INTEGER value.	YEAR ( date )	YEAR ( datetime-expression )
